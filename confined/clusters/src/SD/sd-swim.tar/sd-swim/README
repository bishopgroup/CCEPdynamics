Stokesian Dynamics Code for simulating swimming in unbounded Stokes flow.
Copyright 2005 - James W. Swan and John F. Brady

To compile this code, simply type 'make' to run 'Makefile' and generate the executable 'sd.x'.
All simulation parameters may be specified in two files which are read by 'sd.x' on execution.
The first is 'pref.in' which contains all the simulation preferences (e.g. number of particles, 
external forces, etc.).  The second is 'conf.in' which contains the initial positions of all the 
particles.  The number of (x, y, z) coordinate sets in 'conf.in' must be greater than or equal 
to the number of particles specified in 'pref.in' for successful execution as the positions are 
read from the top of the file down.  This program outputs the file 'pos.out' which contains the 
positions of the particles in time.  The frequency with which the program outputs this data may be 
adjusted with the parameter 'pos_time' in 'pref.in'.  An additional output mode which replaces the 
time code with a series of dashes may be set in 'pref.in' as well.  This output may be useful for 
some when generating movies from the data in 'pos.out'.  Additional information about the code is 
available at the top of the file 'sd.f90' and in the extensive comments distributed throughout the code.
